🏥 Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Ensemble AI Approach 👁️‍🗨️
📌 Overview
This project focuses on Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models. The approach leverages multiple CNN-based architectures to improve accuracy and robustness in classifying retinal fundus images into different severity levels of diabetic retinopathy. The ensemble method combines the strengths of different models to achieve better generalization and performance.

🚀 Features
✅ Multi-Model Ensemble – Combines predictions from multiple deep learning models for improved accuracy.
✅ Automated Diabetic Retinopathy Detection – Classifies retinal images into different severity levels.
✅ Flask Web App – Interactive web-based interface for easy predictions.
✅ Optimized for Performance – Fine-tuned models for high efficiency.
